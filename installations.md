# Installations

Now that we know why we're here, it's time for us to set up our environment so we can create our project.
There are a couple of things we are going to need, as listed below. It's important we install things in the order they appear in the list, as some of them rely on previous installations.

# Before We Start
During the installation process we'll be using the Terminal a lot. The Terminal is a textual intreface that allows us to run commands.
To open the Terminal, follow these instructions:
